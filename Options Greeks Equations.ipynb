    "## The Greeks\n",
    "\n",
    "In mathematical terms, the Greeks are simply the partial derivatives of the option pricing formula. In other words, these are the sensitivities in the movement of the option price relative to the movement of other aspects of the input variables. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because the assumptions required for the Black-Scholes model do not hold true in practice, the plain vanilla formula presented above is not usually used for pricing options for the purposes of trading. (In fact if one were to rely on Black-Scholes to manage a portfolio of options, that trader would surely lose money.) It is however, largely used for understanding the sensitivities of the option with respect to it's parameters and to hedge."

    "### Interpretation of Black-Scholes Results\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Delta\n",
    "- **Call Delta (0.5546)**: This indicates that for a small increase in the underlying stock price, the price of the call option is expected to increase by approximately 0.5546 units. A delta of 0.5546 means the call option is moderately sensitive to changes in the stock price.\n",
    "- **Put Delta (-0.4454)**: This indicates that for a small increase in the underlying stock price, the price of the put option is expected to decrease by approximately 0.4454 units. A delta of -0.4454 means the put option is moderately sensitive to changes in the stock price, but in the opposite direction to the call option.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Gamma\n",
    "- **Gamma (0.0524)**: A gamma of 0.0524 means that for a small increase in the stock price, the delta of the option will increase by 0.0524. Gamma is the same for both call and put options and measures the convexity of the option's value.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Vega\n",
    "- **Vega (0.1192)**: A vega of 0.1192 means that for a 1% increase in volatility, the price of the option is expected to increase by approximately 0.1192 units. Both call and put options have the same vega.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Theta\n",
    "- **Call Theta (-0.0103)**: This indicates the rate at which the price of the call option declines as time passes, holding all else constant. A theta of -0.0103 means that the call option loses approximately 0.0103 units of its value per day.\n",
    "- **Put Theta (-0.0078)**: A theta of -0.0078 means that the put option loses approximately 0.0078 units of its value per day. Both call and put options typically have negative theta, reflecting the time decay of options.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Rho\n",
    "- **Call Rho (0.0978)**: A rho of 0.0978 means that for a 1% increase in the interest rate, the price of the call option is expected to increase by approximately 0.0978 units.\n",
    "- **Put Rho (-0.1026)**: A rho of -0.1026 means that for a 1% increase in the interest rate, the price of the put option is expected to decrease by approximately 0.1026 units. Rho for calls is positive as higher rates increase the call's value, while rho for puts is negative as higher rates decrease the put's value."
